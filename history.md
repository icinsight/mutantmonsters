# How Mutants were distributed in 2019:

## 1. Giveaways a.k.a. airdrops

### 1.1. Monster Mash

The intial distribution was done in three giveaways in 2019. Users signed up in discord.

The first one was the Halloween giveaway. Each signed up user got a new Mutant every day during the week of October 27 or so.

These Mutants had Halloween props and other special features:

### 1.2. Thanks-giveaway

The same was repeated during Thanknsgiving week, but without props or specials

These two campaigns distributed 358 unique Mutants, and breeding could start!


## 2. Mining

It was also possible to mint Mutants by sending mineable tokens into "Mutant Machine." That method is described in

https://github.com/icinsight/mutantmonsters

## 3. Auto-Breeding

There was an automated daily draw that generated new mutant generations to existing mutants. Each day 5-10 Mutants were minted and 1 or 2 of them were so-called Alphas, i.e., characters that did not exist before in any format.
